        <h1>Human Heart</h1>
        <p class="Human_Heart">The human heart is a muscular organ that functions as the central pump of the circulatory system, responsible for circulating blood throughout the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients while removing waste products. It is located in the chest, slightly left of center, and is protected by the ribcage. The heart is roughly the size of a fist and is composed of four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers). The right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation, while the left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body.

            The heart’s internal structure includes several important features. The walls of the heart are made up of three layers: the epicardium (outer layer), myocardium (middle muscular layer), and endocardium (inner lining). The myocardium is particularly thick in the ventricles, especially the left ventricle, because it needs to generate enough force to pump blood to the entire body. Blood flow through the heart is regulated by four valves: the tricuspid valve between the right atrium and ventricle, the pulmonary valve between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, the mitral valve between the left atrium and ventricle, and the aortic valve between the left ventricle and the aorta. These valves ensure that blood flows in only one direction and prevents backflow during the cardiac cycle.
            
            The heart functions through a regular rhythm, controlled by an electrical conduction system. The sinoatrial (SA) node, located in the right atrium, acts as the heart's natural pacemaker, initiating electrical impulses that spread through the atria, causing them to contract. The impulses then reach the atrioventricular (AV) node, and after a brief delay, they travel down the bundle of His and Purkinje fibers to the ventricles, triggering their contraction. This process ensures that the heart pumps blood efficiently in a coordinated manner.
            
            The circulatory system is divided into two main circuits: the pulmonary circulation and the systemic circulation. Pulmonary circulation involves the flow of blood from the right ventricle to the lungs, where it is oxygenated before returning to the left atrium. Systemic circulation refers to the flow of oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle through the aorta to the rest of the body, where it delivers oxygen and picks up carbon dioxide and other waste products to be returned to the right side of the heart. The heart also helps maintain blood pressure, ensuring that blood reaches all tissues and organs to support metabolic functions. The heart's efficiency is essential for overall health, and any dysfunction in its structure or electrical system can lead to serious health conditions, such as heart disease or arrhythmias.</p>

    <h1>Human Lung</h1>
     <p id="Human_Lung"> The human lungs are intricate organs essential for the respiratory system, designed to facilitate gas exchange, which is vital for maintaining life. They are located within the thoracic cavity and are divided into lobes; the right lung has three lobes, while the left lung has two, providing space for the heart on the left side of the chest. The lungs are encased in a protective membrane called the pleura, which produces fluid to reduce friction during breathing movements. Air enters the body through the nose or mouth, travels through the trachea, and then branches into the bronchi. The bronchi divide further into smaller bronchioles, eventually leading to microscopic air sacs called alveoli. These alveoli are the key sites for gas exchange. They are surrounded by a network of capillaries, where oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, moves from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled.
 The lungs also have a crucial role in regulating the body’s acid-base balance. They help control blood pH by adjusting the levels of carbonic acid, which is derived from carbon dioxide. Additionally, the lungs act as a filter for harmful substances, trapping dust, microbes, and pollutants in mucus, which is then removed by the action of cilia lining the airways. The diaphragm, a large muscle beneath the lungs, plays a key role in breathing by contracting and relaxing to enable the inhalation and exhalation of air. The lungs are also equipped with a defense mechanism to prevent infections, as they are lined with immune cells that can detect and respond to pathogens. Proper lung function is critical for overall health, and conditions such as asthma, pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can significantly impair this process, highlighting the importance of lung health.</p>

    <h1>Human Brain</h1>
    <p>The human brain is an incredibly complex and sophisticated organ that serves as the control center of the nervous system, responsible for regulating a wide range of vital functions and cognitive processes. It is composed of approximately 86 billion neurons, which are specialized cells that transmit electrical signals throughout the body. The brain is divided into three main sections: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, each responsible for different functions. The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum, is located in the forebrain and is divided into two hemispheres (left and right), each controlling the opposite side of the body. The cerebrum is responsible for higher-order functions such as thought, memory, voluntary movement, reasoning, and emotions. It is also divided into lobes: the frontal lobe (involved in decision-making, problem-solving, and motor function), parietal lobe (responsible for sensory processing and spatial awareness), temporal lobe (involved in hearing, language, and memory), and occipital lobe (responsible for visual processing).
The midbrain, located beneath the cerebrum, plays a crucial role in processing sensory information and controlling movement. It is involved in functions such as vision, hearing, and motor control, and contains structures like the substantia nigra, which is important for movement regulation and is affected in conditions like Parkinson's disease. The hindbrain consists of the cerebellum and the brainstem. The cerebellum, located at the back of the brain, is crucial for coordinating voluntary movements, maintaining balance, and fine-tuning motor activities. The brainstem, which connects the brain to the spinal cord, controls essential life functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure, as well as basic reflexes like swallowing and blinking.
        The brain is protected by several layers of defense. The skull provides physical protection, while the meninges, a set of three membranes, offer additional shielding. The brain is also surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, which acts as a cushion and helps remove waste products. Communication between neurons occurs through synapses, where chemical neurotransmitters transmit signals. The brain also relies on a network of blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to sustain its high metabolic demands. Additionally, the brain's functions are regulated by complex electrical activity, which can be measured using techniques like electroencephalography (EEG).
        The brain's ability to process sensory input, generate motor output, and engage in cognitive functions is supported by its remarkable plasticity, which allows it to adapt and reorganize itself in response to learning, experiences, and injury. The human brain's intricate structure and diverse functions make it one of the most advanced organs in the body, controlling everything from basic survival functions to complex thinking, emotions, and social interactions.</p>
